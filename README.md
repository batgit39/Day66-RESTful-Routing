# Day66-RESTful-Routing
Today I learned how to make a RESTful api using flask and sql alchemy. And check the api using Postman which also publishes api docs.

I used different methods like GET POST PATCH and DELETE

Here's the link to documentation : https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/27455024/2s93kxcRaG
